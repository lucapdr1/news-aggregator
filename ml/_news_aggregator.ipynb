The $22 million effort does not say it is specifically intended for Trump, but that it wants a conservative as the next commander-in-chief.\\n\\nThe project, published in 2023, includes a nearly 1,000-page handbook that detailed a conservative agenda for the next president. Project 2025 said on its website that the handbook is \\u201cthe next conservative President\\u2019s last opportunity to save our republic.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is not enough for conservatives to win elections,\\u201d Project 2025 said on its website. \\u201cIf we are going to rescue the country from the grip of the radical Left, we need both a governing agenda and the right people in place, ready to carry this agenda out on day one of the next conservative administration.

The Tesla vehicles facing the recall had signals going off at improper times, the NHTSA said in a report released Thursday.\\n\\nThis recall contributes to the company\\u2019s 2.5 million recalls issued this year so far.\\n\\nIn January, Tesla recalled certain 2023 Y, S and X model vehicles due to a software issue that prevented the camera image from showing images while the Teslas are in reverse. The following month, Tesla recalled almost 2.2 million vehicles because of \\u201cincorrect font size\\u201d on its instrument panel for its brake, park and antilock brake system warning lights. Then, in April, Tesla recalled all MY 2024 Cybertrucks made between November 13, 2023, to April 4, 2024 due to faulty accelerator pedals.\\n\\nTesla also had the highest accident rate of any car in 2023, according to a Lending Tree analysis last year, with 23.54 accidents per 1,000 drivers.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what we know about the most recent Tesla recall.\\n\\nWhat exactly is defective in the models?\\n\\nOn certain vehicles with specific seat belt software, there is no required audible and visual seat belt reminder for drivers even when the driver\\u2019s seat belt is not fashioned, because of faulty tracing in driver\\u2019s seat occupancy.\\n\\nWhen did Tesla first find out about the discrepancy?\\n\\nOn April 18, Tesla identified this discrepancy with seat belt reminders as a part of an internal compliance audit with the 2024 Tesla Model X, and then investigated the condition through the rest of April and May.\\n\\nAfter Tesla completed their investigation in late May, the company voluntarily recalled the affected vehicles.\\n\\nWhich models are impacted by the recall?\\n\\nThe Tesla models impacted by the recall include 2012-2024 Model S, 2015-2024 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y that are with the defective seat belt logic system.\\n\\nHas there been any collisions, injuries or fatalities as a result of the issue?\\n\\nIn the NHTSA report, Tesla stated as of May 28, the company identified 104 warranty claims that may be related to the condition, but the company states that it is not aware Tesla is of any collisions, fatalities or injuries that may be related to the condition\\n\\nHow will Tesla remedy the problem for customers?\\n\\nTesla plans to send out a free over-the-air (OTA) software remedy to customers with affected vehicles in June of this year.

And now, for the first time ever there will be a beer sponsor for an event that showcases the pinnacle of human sporting achievements.\\n\\nBut in this case, the drink\\u2014Corona Cero\\u2014doesn\\u2019t have any alcohol.\\n\\nThe world\\u2019s biggest brewer has chosen to advertise to billions of sports fans a zero-alcohol product only launched in Europe two years ago. AB InBev hopes to use the Paris Games\\u2014expected to be one of the biggest marketing bonanzas the Olympics has ever seen\\u2014to improve its position in the only part of the global beer industry that\\u2019s really growing.\\n\\nRead More: Why Beer Is the World\\u2019s Most Beloved Drink\\n\\nWorth $13 billion and counting, brands from Heineken to Guinness, and now Corona Cero, see a cohort of health-conscious consumers\\u2014many young, others older and wanting out of a booze culture\\u2014whose wallets they can tap.\\n\\nMaster brewers have been working on formulas to try to replicate the taste and texture of the real thing. Heineken, Guinness and Budweiser are all now available alcohol-free, while hundreds of craft brewers and newer labels are emerging to target the market.\\n\\nFor Michel Doukeris, the chief executive officer of AB InBev, it\\u2019s quite simple: \\u201cThe consumer has changed.\\u201d\\n\\nNo-alcohol beer, or beer with alcohol content under 0.5%, is a tiny corner of the market, its 31.4 million hectoliters a year dwarfed by the 1.93 billion hectoliters of alcoholic beer, according to GlobalData Plc. But it\\u2019s had an annual compound growth rate of 3.6% since 2018, versus 0.3% for alcoholic beer. In the U.S., adults age 18 to 34 who say they drink has dropped from 72% in the early 2000s to 62%, according to Gallup.\\n\\nThose are numbers businesses can\\u2019t ignore, especially AB InBev. It\\u2019s already lagging behind and says it will miss a target of 20% of sales from low or no-alcohol beer by 2025.\\n\\n\\u201cThere are a lot of sports events like the Olympics where the flagship brands are often the 0% variant,\\u201d said Susie Goldspink, head of no and low alcohol insights at market researcher IWSR. \\u201cThat\\u2019s partly because it\\u2019s such a growing area but it also helps with their moderation agenda of responsible drinking.\\u201d\\n\\nThere\\u2019s also a wider benefit for beer companies. Because their no-alcohol versions often share the same name and labelling as the original beer, the promotions help brand awareness and allow firms to circumvent increasingly tighter restrictions around alcohol advertising.\\n\\nThe Olympics is part of a trend of zero-alcohol beers being promoted via sport, including Heineken 0.0 with Formula 1 and Diageo Plc\\u2019s Guinness 0.0 at the Six Nations rugby tournament. Carlsberg A/S last year handed out 400,000 cans of French no-alcohol beer Tourtel Twist at the Tour de France cycling race.\\n\\nRead more: How to Talk About Beer Like a Pro\\n\\nAnd in a sign of the competition between brands, Carlsberg is positioning Tourtel Twist as the non-alcoholic beer of choice at the Paris Games.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are the official beer of Paris and France,\\u201d said Jacob Aarup-Andersen, CEO of Carlsberg. \\u201cThey are the official beer of the Olympic movement. At the events you are going to be served Tourtel.\\u201d\\n\\nU.S.-based Athletic Brewing Co., which sells only non-alcoholic drinks, says an Olympic sponsorship benefits the entire category.\\n\\n\\u201cSometimes to move the needle you need bigger players that can help drive awareness,\\u201d said John Walker, the company\\u2019s co-founder.\\n\\nFor drinks companies, there\\u2019s a pressing need to keep up with shifting trends that have already proved the death knell for many businesses. More than 7,000 bars in the U.K. closed in the last decade, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. While alcohol duties, rents, costs and regulations all played a part, so too have changing drinking habits.\\n\\nAs consumers, particularly social media-driven millennial and Gen Z demographic groups, look to temper their alcohol intake, it\\u2019s better to have a viable\\u2014and attractive\\u2014offering rather than have them turn to a rival brand, a soda or water.\\n\\nHeineken 0.0 is the market leader in the no-alcohol beer market globally, according to GlobalData. Other big sellers are Japan\\u2019s Suntory All-Free, and Brahma 0.0%, owned by AB InBev.\\n\\nAt the world\\u2019s oldest continuously operating brewery in Germany, non-alcoholic beers have been in production since the early 1990s. But in 2020, thanks to rising demand, Bavaria-owned Weihenstephan more than doubled its alcohol-free beer capacity, taking a bet on future growth. Today, its non-alcoholic wheat beer is almost 10% of sales, and its third best-selling product.\\n\\nBut all the promotion in the world can only take zero-alcohol beer so far if it isn\\u2019t any good.\\n\\nUntil relatively recently, non-alcoholic beer compared poorly to the original, leaving drinkers unsatisfied. For brewers, there was a technical conundrum: how to achieve the depth of taste without alcohol. Do they stop beer from forming alcohol during the fermentation process or do they remove it after brewing a full-strength version?\\n\\nAccording to Jim Koch, chairman of Boston Beer Company, which makes Samuel Adams, taste breakthroughs have only been possible in recent years as brewers figured out a low temperature distillation process. The brewer introduced its own non-alcohol product, Just The Haze, in 2021.\\n\\nLaunched in 2017, Heineken 0.0 is made with water, barley malt, hop extracts and yeast\\u2014the same ingredients used for Heineken. The alcohol is then removed using vacuum distillation, after which natural flavorings and aromas are blended back in to make the taste more closely resemble the original.\\n\\n\\u201cFor a couple of years, I refused to start developing Heineken 0.0,\\u201d said Willem van Waesberghe, Heineken\\u2019s global master brewer. \\u201cBecause I\\u2019d never tasted a good one.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Olympic Games kick off in two months, with the Opening Ceremony taking place on July 26. AB InBev will soon unveil details of its campaign, which it expects will \\u201caccelerate no-alcohol beer growth.\\u201d\\n\\nBeyond that, getting no-alcohol beer on tap is expected to deliver the next leap in terms of volumes, increasing sales in bars by making the drinks more socially acceptable. It\\u2019s yet another technical challenge, but one that brewers are working on.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s like ros\\u00e9 in the south of France is always better than at home,\\u201d said Waesberghe. \\u201cAnd in a bar you like the draft, it gives you the impression of authenticity.\\u201d\", \"url\": \"https://time.com/6984221/zero-alcohol-beer-corona-cero-sponsor-paris-olympics/\"}, {\"newspaper\": \"https://time.com/\", \"title\": \"How TIME Chose the 100 Most Influential Companies of 2024\", \"date\": \"2024-05-30\", \"text\": \"In May, TIME\\u2019s Billy Perrigo traveled to San Francisco to meet with Dario Amodei, the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most important artificial intelligence startups in the world.

In London this week to promote his work building social businesses, the Nobel prizewinner and founder of Grameen bank is compelling when he talks about his ideas to address poverty. But, after the recent microfinance fallout, there's a nagging feeling that what he's saying is a little too good to be true.\\n\\nYunus's latest idea is an international minimum wage for the garment industry, following the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in Savar, Bangladesh, last month, which killed more than 1,100 people. Yunus suggests increasing the hourly wage of Bangladeshi workers \\u2013 the majority of whom are women \\u2013 by around $0.50. Foreign clothing firms could use this as a marketing tool to promote their product \\u2013 garments made by these workers could be tagged as ethically sourced.\\n\\nThis \\\"tax\\\" on the garment industry would help women \\\"tremendously\\\", Yunus tells me. Women, he says, have transformed society in Bangladesh. \\\"[The garment industry] brought 4 million young women from the villages to the city, where they live independently. It's transformed society.\\\" Bangladesh is now the second-largest garment producer in the world, and, says Yunus, in the process of becoming so, traditional beliefs that women should stay at home have been challenged.\\n\\n\\\"There are walls, but if you look close, [you see] there are lots of holes, so we take advantage of the holes,\\\" says Yunus. Show that an investment or project is beneficial to society and the cultural barriers will begin to fall. \\\"If you can do something despite opposition in the beginning, if it's proven that people like it \\u2026 all opinions will come around to it because people like it.\\\"\\n\\nYunus is clearly a champion of women. They were central in the creation of Grameen bank in 1983. Over the past 30 years, the bank has lent money to around 8.5 million people; more than 95% have been women.\\n\\nBut while women may have helped transform Bangladesh's economy, many have few other options than to put up with the poor conditions and low wages the industry offers. The UN says only 23% of Bangladesh's labour force are women. And a report by Human Rights Watch last year found that the country still has discriminatory laws on marriage and divorce that contribute to women's poverty.\\n\\nWhile it could be easy to disregard Yunus's ideas as pie-in-the-sky optimism, listening to him talk, and looking at his impressive track record, does make you believe in possibilities.\\n\\nDespite microfinance falling off its lofty perch, and a battle at Grameen that saw Yunus forced to resign as managing director, the bank is still going strong. It has teamed up with Tesco in the UK to offer loans in Scotland and has branches around the US. Yunus still passionately believes microcredit can be a force for good. \\\"It's not the fault of microfinance, it's the fault of the way we have used this idea,\\\" he says. \\\"We developed microfinance to fight loan sharks \\u2013 I was telling people don't go to loan sharks \\u2013 not trying to take advantage and make money for myself. I would be a junior loan shark if I did \\u2026 It is not a panacea.\\\"\\n\\nHis philosophy is simple \\u2013 start small and don't be afraid of failure. Yunus first dipped his toe into lending in 1976, when he lent $27 to a group of poor people in Dhaka to avoid them having to use loan sharks. He then acted as guarantor for loans taken out at local banks that refused to lend money to poorer people.\\n\\n\\\"Make it very small, don't be ambitious,\\\" he told an audience at the London Stock Exchange Group on Tuesday. \\\"Don't worry about failure. Any business has a 50-50 chance of being wrong. Change of circumstances doesn't mean we have to go back and forget about it, but go back and redesign \\u2026 wait for an opportunity and turn it around.\\\"\\n\\nThat's what happened when Grameen's partnership with the French food company Danone ran into difficulties. Established in 2006 to produce cheap, nutritious yoghurt to improve malnutrition rates in Bangladesh, the partnership soon encountered problems \\u2013 people weren't buying the yoghurt, there were problems with refrigeration, and milk prices rose \\u2013 making it difficult to offer a product people could afford. There was a choice of ending the partnership or rethinking the strategy. The companies opted for the latter. Grameen Danone has diversified its products, producing a yoghurt drink that uses less milk and needs less refrigeration, and is creating more storage facilities.\\n\\n\\\"Business is a very beautiful mechanism to solve problems, but we never use it for that purpose. We only use it to make money. It satisfies our selfish interest but not our collective interest,\\\" Yunus told the audience of financiers.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not against making money, but I am saying we can do both. We have designed a capitalist system wrong. We assume human beings are one-dimensional, all they do is make money, so we've created a money-centric world. Money commands everything because that's our interpretation of capitalism \\u2026 what kind of world is that? It's a very uncomfortable interpretation of a human being. We have been turned into robots. Yes we are selfish, but also selfless, but we don't allow that to be brought out.\\\"\\n\\nA paradigm shift is unlikely to happen soon. But after spending a couple of hours listening to Yunus, you begin to wonder whether maybe it could just happen \\u2013 one day.\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/may/24/muhammad-yunus-business-solve-problems\"}, {\"newspaper\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/europe\", \"title\": \"John Wilson: 'Music is either worth doing or it's not'\", \"date\": \"2017-04-20\", \"text\": \"\\u201cNourish that a little more, really make it sing,\\u201d says John Wilson. \\u201cKeep those quavers purposeful. .\\u201d The conductor and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra are rehearsing Mendelssohn\\u2019s Hebrides Overture, a piece the orchestra could play perfectly adequately in its sleep, but there will be no slumber here.

He will also conduct them at the Proms this summer, and makes a second visit to the Royal Albert Hall the following month to perform Oklahoma! \\u2013 he isn\\u2019t about to abandon Hollywood \\u2013 with his own hand-picked orchestra.\\n\\nAfter six hours of rehearsal during which he has relentlessly rooted out anonymous quavers and inimical minims \\u2013 \\u201cI may be doing it right or I may be doing it tastelessly, but let me do it my way,\\u201d he says at one point \\u2013 we talk, oddly enough on the stage where he has just been rehearsing. A public conversation with no public.\\n\\nWilson started working with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in 2002, initially doing mainly light music. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always done that and I\\u2019ve never apologised for it, but they gradually let me spread my wings over the years and I\\u2019ve done everything from Eric Coates to Dutilleux with them. I\\u2019m grateful to them for not pigeonholing me.\\u201d He will conduct Vaughan Williams and Holst\\u2019s Planets with the orchestra at the Proms \\u2013 another standard repertoire piece that he promises to breathe fresh life into. \\u201cThe Planets is a party piece of mine; I do it differently every time. A performance is only ever a snapshot of how you feel about a piece on any particular day.\\u201d\\n\\nHe does, though, still get pigeonholed by some, as was demonstrated by one response to his LSO concert. \\u201cI had to learn the Turnage trumpet concerto in a day, which was something. Rach 2 I knew inside out,\\u201d says Wilson. \\u201cThere was one review that talked about me making the leap from doing light music to symphonic music. I thought \\u2018Hang on. That\\u2019s what I do all the time.\\u2019 It implies I\\u2019m just wandering the world conducting Hello, Dolly! [In fact] I\\u2019ve done about 11 symphonies this year so far.\\u201d\\n\\nLast year he conducted Madama Butterfly at Glyndebourne Touring Opera, and is in discussion with the summer festival for a future project \\u2013 he won\\u2019t say what. He also has three other operas lined up. \\u201cMy work is guest-conducting symphony orchestras in standard repertoire,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI\\u2019m recording Copland with the BBC Philharmonic and will start making records here too. I\\u2019m never going to moan about the fact that there are some people who think I only do one thing \\u2013 better to be pigeonholed in the eyes of the public for something than to sit at home twiddling your thumbs, but my musical diet is very varied.\\u201d\\n\\nHe puts the range of his repertoire down to his unusual background: working-class boy from Gateshead who fell in love with music (and Hollywood musicals in particular), taught himself to play the piano with the help of a musical mother, did A-level music at Newcastle College and formed his first orchestra at the age of 16.\\n\\n\\u201cI had a good school music teacher and a percussion teacher who took me under his wing,\\u201d he recalls in an accent that retains its Geordie lilt. \\u201cThere was a lot of amateur music-making \\u2013 brass bands, orchestras, choirs and operatic societies doing Gilbert and Sullivan. I cut my teeth doing all of that and loved every minute of it, which is probably why I\\u2019ve always been a practical musician.\\u201d He never had any doubt that his life would be devoted to music. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always known I was going to be in music, ever since I can remember. It wasn\\u2019t even that I particularly wanted to. I had to do it. There was a fire in my belly. I still feel like that. I still get thrilled if anybody rings me up and offers me a gig.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe thing I\\u2019ve held on to throughout my career is that I never wanted to just do one thing,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI guess that comes from the fact that I\\u2019m largely self-taught, and when you\\u2019re 10 or 11 and just listening to music because you love it you\\u2019ve got nobody to tell you what you should or shouldn\\u2019t be listening to. That manifests itself in a rather zany repertoire list \\u2013 I have done lots of things that other conductors might not touch.\\u201d\\n\\nWilson went on to the Royal College of Music, joining as what he calls a \\u201creluctant and not very good percussion player\\u201d but switched to composition and, later, conducting. \\u201cI had a couple of professors who ensured I was given the time and encouragement to blossom, and I went from being almost thrown out at the end of my first year to winning the Tagore Gold Medal [the college\\u2019s foremost award for students]. They just let me do my thing.\\u201d\\n\\nHe started his own eponymous orchestra in 1994, when he was just 22. \\u201cIt happened by accident,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI was playing the piano at the Grosvenor House hotel when I was still a student. I did afternoon tea with a violinist and evening concerts with a jazz trio. So I ended up having two sets of friends \\u2013 Royal College of Music classical musicians and friends from the Guildhall and the Academy who were jazz players, and it was the fusion of those two sets of enthusiasms that led us to play this jazz-tinged orchestral music. It went from being just for fun to being something that people outside of us were interested in and we got offered gigs and residencies.\\u201d The John Wilson Orchestra was born, and is still touring, and wowing audiences at the Proms each year where their concert is always one of the first to sell out.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat I am interested in and have always been interested in are songs, whether they be by Schubert or Cole Porter or Harold Arlen or Jerome Kern,\\u201d he says. He is a one-man scourge of musical barriers. \\u201cWhat is the division? Why is it there? Why is Schubert any different from the best songs of Arlen, which are in themselves complete emotional worlds and take just as much care and attention to detail in interpretation and delivery. It\\u2019s either worth doing or it\\u2019s not.\\u201d\\n\\nWherever his guest-conducting career takes him, however, he has no intention of abandoning his own orchestra or the Hollywood side of his musical personality. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like my dessert,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s totally different repertoire and the only place I ever really do it.\\u201d What if a really huge job came up? \\u201cI\\u2019m not looking for a huge job,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI\\u2019m looking for a job that would satisfy me. My ambitions, such as they are, are entirely musical. They\\u2019re about pieces I want to do and that I think I have something to say about.\\u201d He likes to quote Simon Rattle\\u2019s line about conductors only really getting going after they reach 60. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been conducting for about 30 years now,\\u201d says Wilson, \\u201cso I feel I might if I\\u2019m lucky get to the starting gate soon.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Proms begin on 14 July.

I understood that I had crossed the point of no return. I did not want to disappear in silence,\\u201d Zaurbekova recalled, in her first interview since she escaped Russia.\\n\\nDays earlier, Zaurbekova fled her parent\\u2019s flat in the Russian capital after what she described as years of \\u201cphysical and psychological violence, total control and freedom restriction\\u201d at their hands.\\n\\nWhat followed was a cat-and-mouse chase involving her father and other Chechen men, including distant relatives, who tracked her down to an apartment where she had been hiding. After she escaped again to a police station, they then set up camp outside as she pleaded with local officers to protect her.\\n\\nZaurbekova is one of a cohort of Chechen women who have tried to escape a deeply sexist and oppressive life upheld by the longstanding strongman, Ramzan Kadyrov, known for its myriad human rights abuses and rampant domestic violence.\\n\\nThe Kremlin has granted Kadyrov free rein to rule the region as his personal fiefdom, in return for pacifying the once rebellious republic through repression and substantial investment from Moscow.\\n\\nOver the years, Kadyrov\\u2019s security services, with the approval of the Kremlin, have grown more brazen, abducting women and regime critics within the country, raising fears that it can operate freely far beyond the borders of the tightly controlled Caucasus republic.\\n\\nAs she looked down from the third floor of the police station to see her father and others calling her to come downstairs, she said she knew the stakes could not be higher.\\n\\n\\u201cI understood that if they got their hands on me it would be the end.

The results were true even for people in the trial who were 65 years and older. Generally, older people don\\u2019t mount as robust a response to vaccines as younger people do.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen we think about the combination vaccine, we often only think about the element of convenience, one shot instead of two, but what is really, really breakthrough is the fact that you not only offer that advantage, you also offer the proof of clinical benefit. I think this is the most important message,\\u201d Ceddia said.\\n\\nOther companies have been testing a combined Covid-flu vaccine, but Moderna is the first to announce positive late-stage trial results.\\n\\nPublic health leaders say the world could use more ways to protect people from both viruses. Millions of people get sick with the flu and now Covid every year. For the last flu season, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 35 to 64 million people got sick with the flu in the United States. Between 390,000 and 810,000 people were so sick they were hospitalized and up to 71,000 people died. Just for last fall and winter, Covid sent more than a half-million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000, according to data presented last week to the US Food and Drug Administration\\u2019s independent vaccine advisers, who were discussing how to update Covid vaccines for the fall.\\n\\nModerna\\u2019s Phase 3 trial was a randomized, observer-blind, active control study, meaning that even the clinicians giving the shots didn\\u2019t know who got which vaccines. The trial studied the vaccine in two different age groups with about 4,000 adults in each age category.\\n\\nFor one part of the study, Moderna compared the immune reaction of adults 65 and older who got mRNA-1083 and another group with the same age range who got a co-administered Covid-19 vaccine, Moderna\\u2019s Spikevax, and an enhanced flu vaccine, Fluzone HD. Doctors recommend seniors get more powerful flu vaccines due to their inhibited immune systems.\\n\\nFor the other part of the trial, researchers compared how slightly younger adults, ages 50 to 64, did when they got the mRNA-1083 vaccine to another group within the same age range who got Spikevax and a standard dose flu vaccine called Fluarix.\\n\\nStudy results showed that in both age groups, the experimental combination vaccine elicited a statistically significant higher immune response against three strains of the flu and against Covid-19, compared with the co-administered shots.\\n\\n\\u201cThe titers are significantly higher,\\u201d Ceddia said. \\u201cThis is better actually.\\u201d A titer is a lab test that measures the number of antibodies in the blood and it can be used to prove how immune someone is to the disease.\\n\\nIn terms of safety, the combined vaccine was well-tolerated, Moderna said, and the adverse reactions were similar to what people experienced with the co-administered vaccines. The most common complaints were pain at the injection site, tiredness, muscle pain and headaches.\\n\\nThe study isn\\u2019t peer-reviewed yet, but Moderna said it plans to present data from this late-stage trial at an upcoming medical conference and it will also submit the trial for publication. Moderna also said it will talk to the FDA about possible next steps.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need to engage with regulators but our aspiration is to have it approved for fall 2025,\\u201d Moderna CEO St\\u00e9phane Bancel told CNN.\\n\\nSue Peschin, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Aging Research, a nonprofit dedicated to improving aging and health that encourages more equitable access to vaccines, said a combined shot could be a significant help to public health.\\n\\nIn addition to intensifying vaccine hesitancy in the US, people have developed a kind of vaccine fatigue after the pandemic, Peschin said. Peschin pointed to the drop in the uptake in standard vaccines such as the MMR vaccine, as well as in seasonal vaccines.\\n\\nFew people got the latest Covid shot, studies show. Only about 25% of the eligible population has received the latest Covid-19 vaccine, according to a presentation to the FDA last week. Many more adults got the flu shot with nearly half of the adult population getting one last season, according to the CDC, a number that was slightly higher than the year before.\\n\\n\\u201cWe want to see that go up and if there\\u2019s a way to do that by combining the vaccines, then that\\u2019s better for everyone because it helps protect everyone in the community,\\u201d Peschin said. \\u201cWe would love to see the combination vaccines come to market if the FDA deems them safe and effective.\\u201d\\n\\nCNN\\u2019s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.\", \"url\": \"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/moderna-covid-flu-combination-vaccine-positive-results/index.html\"}, {\"newspaper\": \"https://edition.cnn.com/\", \"title\": \"Eating what\\u2019s best for the planet can lengthen your life, study says\", \"date\": \"2024-06-10\", \"text\": \"Sign up for CNN\\u2019s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.

Add them up, and they can generate nearly 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, experts say.\\n\\nEating a planet-healthy diet, however, cut land use by 51%, greenhouse gas emissions by 29% and fertilizer use by 21%, while also extending the lives of people, according to the study.\\n\\n\\u201cChanging how we eat can help slow climate change, and fortunately what\\u2019s healthiest for the planet is also best for us,\\u201d said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H.

Every four years for 34 years, study participants filled out dietary questionnaires, providing researchers with an enormous amount of data.\\n\\nResearchers then scored the diets based on the intake of 15 food groups. Foods that are good for the planet take fewer overall resources to grow and include whole grains, tubers, vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, soybean foods and unsaturated plant oils, such as olive oil.\\n\\nFoods that require a large use of land, such as cattle, and to a lesser extent sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, were also measured, as was intake of added sugar, which has many known health risks.\\n\\nWhile other studies have looked at the impact of the planetary health diet, none has matched the scope of this study, Willett said. \\u201cThis is a substantially larger and much longer study which has repeated assessments of diet over more than three decades, which allows more statistical precision,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe top 10% of people who followed the Eat-Lancet planetary diet were 30% less likely to die prematurely from any cause than those in the bottom 10%, the study found.\\n\\nIn addition, those who most closely followed the planetary diet had a 28% lower risk of neurodegenerative mortality, a 14% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, a 10% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 47% lower risk of dying from a respiratory disease, which applied to nonsmokers as well, Willett said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe findings show just how linked human and planetary health are.

Here are Gottlieb\\u2019s top five reasons.\\n\\n1. Therapy offers perspective\\n\\nIdeally, therapy is impartial.\\n\\n\\u201cTherapy is like getting a really good second opinion on your life, from someone who\\u2019s not already in your life,\\u201d Gottlieb said. \\u201cWhen we try to get advice or guidance from people who are close to us, it\\u2019s hard for them to separate out the relationship they have with us and to be able to see the issue objectively.\\u201d\\n\\nOur friends, she said, give us \\u201cidiot compassion\\u201d \\u2014 they loyally validate our feelings often without pointing out our own role in any conflicts. Therapists are trained to give us \\u201cwise compassion,\\u201d she said.\\n\\n\\u201cWe hold up a mirror to you, and we help you to see something about what is getting you stuck, that maybe you haven\\u2019t been willing or able to see. We help you to see something that you can actively change,\\u201d Gottlieb said. \\u201cAnd I think that there\\u2019s something so empowering about that, and it\\u2019s so translatable to many different relationships.\\u201d\\n\\n2. Therapy is a safe space\\n\\nIn therapy, you can explore seemingly frivolous subjects.\\n\\n\\u201cTherapy can make you happier because it helps you to really be intentional about what you want in your life. And I don\\u2019t think we have a lot of spaces to talk about that,\\u201d Gottlieb said, referring to concepts such as life satisfaction.\\n\\n\\u201cSometimes people think, \\u2018Well, I have a roof over my head and food on the table. So this whole thing about meaning and fulfillment \\u2014 I can\\u2019t really talk about that,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cIn therapy, you have a space where you can really ask those hard questions, and nobody\\u2019s judging you and nobody\\u2019s trying to tell you, \\u2018Well, you have enough already.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n3. Therapy helps to connect with others\\n\\nModern times have created an epidemic of loneliness; the pandemic only made it worse. Therapy can be a bridge.\\n\\n\\u201cWe do have this epidemic of loneliness. And I think a lot of people want deeper connections, and they want more meaningful connections, but they don\\u2019t know how to go about it,\\u201d Gottlieb said. \\u201cI think that we all grew up with certain ideas about what relationships look like, what friendships look like. (But) we aren\\u2019t always aware of the ways in which we may be preventing ourselves from having more meaningful relationships.\\u201d\\n\\nFor example, many people avoid conflict or seek it out, while others have social anxiety or never learned the necessary social skills. \\u201cSo we don\\u2019t know how to reach out even if we want to,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I think in therapy, you learn how to create connection in your life, which is one of the most influential factors when it comes to happiness.\\u201d\\n\\n4. Therapy helps us see the big picture\\n\\nTherapy helps people see that they are part of larger forces, and not simply individuals who formed with no external influences.\\n\\n\\u201cWe sometimes feel that the problems are sort of \\u2018out there\\u2019 \\u2014 we don\\u2019t really know that we are part of that dynamic, part of that dance,\\u201d Gottlieb said. \\u201c(Therapy) helps you to process that unfinished business.\\u201d\\n\\nShe pointed out that our parents were human and often did what they learned from their parents. \\u201cAnd (therapy is) a place where you can say, \\u2018What is some of this old stuff that I\\u2019m carrying around with me that I don\\u2019t even realize I\\u2019m carrying around?\\u2019\\u201d she said, noting that once you understand how your history influences how you navigate through the world, you can change patterns.\\n\\n\\u201cIt makes you happier because you\\u2019re not carrying around the burden of something that happened a long time ago,\\u201d she said.\\n\\n5. Therapy helps us control our story\\n\\nOur life is a narrative, and therapy can help us make sense of it.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen you think about our lives \\u2026 they\\u2019re really stories. (Therapy) helps you clarify your story and take authorship of your story,\\u201d Gottlieb said. \\u201cIt helps you to take authorship of your own life. \\u2026 If I\\u2019m creating this one limited time that I have here \\u2014 this one life that I have here \\u2014 why am I letting all these other people write my story for me, and how can I really take ownership of my story?\\u201d\", \"url\": \"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/09/health/therapy-benefits-happiness-wellness/index.html\"}, {\"newspaper\": \"https://edition.cnn.com/\", \"title\": \"More than half of US adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, research finds\", \"date\": \"2024-06-04\", \"text\": \"About 61% of US adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, new research from the American Heart Association predicts. The biggest driver of this trend will be the large number of people who have or will develop high blood pressure, which makes them much more likely to develop dangerous problems like a heart attack or stroke.\\n\\nOther cardiovascular problems include heart attacks, arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or a-fib, heart failure and congenital heart disease.\\n\\nDespite innovations in treatments, heart disease has been the leading killer of Americans for decades, responsible for more than 800,000 deaths every year.\\n\\nIn the research published Tuesday, the association predicts that 45 million adults will have some form of cardiovascular disease \\u2013 excluding high blood pressure \\u2013 or will have a stroke in 2050, up from 28 million in 2020.\\n\\nAn aging population will be another force behind these trends, as the older you get, the more likely you are to have heart problems.\\n\\nBy 2050, 22% of the US will be over the age of 65, whereas seniors made up just 13% of the population 10 years ago, studies say. The median age in the US is projected to increase from 37 in 2010 to 41 in 2050, other research shows.\\n\\nThe American population is also becoming more diverse, and communities of color tend to have a disproportionate number of heart problems. By 2050, people who identify as Hispanic will make up about a quarter of the US population, vs. about 20% today, and people who identify as Black will be 14.4% of the country, up from 13.6% today. The number of people who identify as Asian will also increase, from 6.2% of the population to 8.6%, according to US Census predictions.\\n\\nPeople who identify as Hispanic are projected to have the greatest population growth for cardiovascular disease or stroke, the new research says.\\n\\nBlack adults now have the highest number of heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, the association\\u2019s research shows. They also are projected to have the most problems with poor diet and an inadequate amount of sleep, both behaviors contribute to heart problems.\\n\\nThe biggest overall increase among cardiovascular conditions will be in the number of people who have a stroke, the American Heart Association predicts, jumping from 3.9% to 6.4%. That would nearly double the number of people who have a stroke from 10 million to 20 million adults between 2020 and 2050.\\n\\nIn terms of risk factors, growing numbers of people with obesity and/or diabetes will also raise the risk of heart problems.\\n\\nPoor diet, which can hurt heart health, is projected to be the health behavior that will affect the most people. The report suggests that nearly 70 million young adults alone will be eating poorly in 2050.\\n\\nThe new research predicts that the number of people with obesity will increase from 43.1% to 60.6%, affecting more than 180 million people by 2050. The number with diabetes will increase from 16.3% to 26.8% and impact more than 80 million in that period, the report said.\\n\\nThe report also offers a closer look at the heart health of children. It finds \\u201cconcerning trends\\u201d in key risk factors, including a predicted increase in the number of kids living with obesity, in large part due to a lack of exercise and poor diet. The report projects that the number of US children with obesity will jump from 20.6% in 2020 to 33% in 2050, meaning 26 million kids will have obesity by that time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one positive heart health note, the researchers said: The number of people with high cholesterol is projected to decline. It\\u2019s been falling for years, studies show, due in part to the sharp increase in the number of people who take drugs called statins, which can reduce the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver. A 2023 study found that more than 92 million adults in the US \\u2013 more than a third of the population \\u2013 took a statin in 2018-19, a 197% increase from 2008-09.\\n\\n\\u201cClinical and public health interventions are needed to effectively manage, stem, and even reverse these adverse trends,\\u201d the researchers wrote.\\n\\nOne significant change they suggest is the creation of clinical and policy interventions specifically to help people of color, who are already disproportionally affected by heart problems and who tend to have less access to basic affordable health care.\\n\\nPrevention efforts to improve population health would also be important, the researchers said, and would save the US a significant amount of money. The costs of cardiovascular problems \\u2013 including direct health care costs and productivity losses \\u2013 are expected to almost triple to more than $1.8 trillion by 2050.\", \"url\": \"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/cardiovascular-disease-report-2050/index.html\"}, {\"newspaper\": \"https://edition.cnn.com/\", \"title\": \"Cucumbers recalled due to salmonella contamination risk\", \"date\": \"2024-06-03\", \"text\": \"Fresh cucumbers sold in 14 states have been recalled due to possible contamination with salmonella.\\n\\nFlorida-based Fresh Start Produce recalled the cucumbers, which shipped from May 17 through May 21.
